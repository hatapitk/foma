# Following things just need to be at top of all configure.ac files:

# AC_INIT sets up project metadata:
# first field the name of the "software"
# second field is version identifier iso 8901 date is good if you have no other
#   versioining schemes in mind
# third is email address for bug reports
# fourth is name of packages made by make dist, excluding .tar.gz
# fifth is the project web address
